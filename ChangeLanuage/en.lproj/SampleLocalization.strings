"SampleContent" = "The story is about a rabbit taunting a slow tortoise. Tired of the Hare's arrogant attitude, the Tortoise challenges the Hare to a race.[2] The Hare quickly left the Tortoise behind. Convinced that he would win, the Rabbit stopped to rest in the middle of the race to take a nap. However, when he woke up, the Rabbit realized that his opponent, who was still crawling slowly, had reached the finish line before him. The version contained in La Fontaine's Fables (VI. 10) was rewritten longer, but in content almost no different from Aesop's version.[3]";
